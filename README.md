# Personal Portfolio Buddy #

### What is it ###
I use Questrade as a broker to trade stocks. One thing I wish Questrade had (which robinhood has) is a graph to historically see the balance of my portfolio as I
traded.

### Plans for the interface ###
First this will be a tool which gets your lots of stocks (quantity purchased for ticker, date, price lot bought at, etc) from an excel/csv file. I plan to first
make this work in the command line then eventually make it into a nice GUI (TKinter, Web App like Django, something else?).
